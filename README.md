# ChatGPTxESP32
This GitHub repository hosts code for an ESP32-based project that enables interaction with the OpenAI GPT-3 language model and remote code execution via Wi-Fi.

# ESP32 WiFi ChatGPT Client

This ESP32-based project allows you to connect to a WiFi network and interact with the OpenAI GPT-3 language model. You can enter prompts through the Serial Monitor and receive text-based responses generated by GPT-3. Additionally, you can send code snippets to another ESP32 server for remote execution.

## Features

- Connect to a WiFi network using your network credentials.
- Interact with the OpenAI GPT-3 service by entering prompts via the Serial Monitor.
- Send GPT-3 responses to another ESP32 server for further processing.
- Execute custom code snippets on the ESP32 server.
- Visual feedback provided through LED indicators.

## Usage

1. **Setup WiFi:**
   - Replace `"Your_WiFi_SSID"` and `"Your_WiFi_Password"` in the code with your actual WiFi credentials.
   - Upload the code to your ESP32 device.

2. **Interaction with GPT-3:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor.
   - Type "GPT" to enter a prompt and receive a GPT-3-generated response.

3. **Sending GPT-3 Responses:**
   - Type "SEND" to send the GPT-3 response to another ESP32 server.

4. **Executing Custom Code:**
   - Type "MYCODE" to enter your own code and send it to the server.

5. **Visual Feedback:**
   - LEDs will blink as specified in the code to provide visual feedback.

## Notes

- Ensure that the second ESP32 server's IP address and port are correctly set in `serverIP` and `serverPort`.
- This code serves as a versatile platform for WiFi-connected IoT applications, GPT-3 integration, and remote code execution.

# ESP32 WiFi Remote Code Execution Server

This ESP32-based project functions as a remote code execution server over WiFi. It accepts incoming connections from other devices, such as ESP32 clients, receives code snippets, executes them, and sends back a response indicating success or error. Additionally, it provides visual feedback through LEDs.

## Features

- Acts as a WiFi-connected server, listening for incoming connections.
- Accepts code snippets from remote devices for execution.
- Executes received code and provides a response.
- Visual feedback through LEDs to indicate status.

## Usage

1. **Setup WiFi:**
   - Set your WiFi SSID and password in the code.
   - Upload the code to your ESP32 device.

2. **Visual Feedback:**
   - The code includes LED blinking patterns for visual feedback.

3. **Remote Code Execution:**
   - Connect to the ESP32 server from a remote device (e.g., another ESP32).
   - Send code snippets to the server for execution.
   - Receive responses indicating the success or error of the executed code.

4. **Customization:**
   - Customize LED patterns and behavior as needed for your application.

## Notes

- This code serves as a foundation for building remote control and code execution systems over WiFi.
- It can be integrated into various IoT and automation projects.
